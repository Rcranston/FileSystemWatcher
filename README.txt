This software should be ready right out of the box..
Somethings to be considered for extra credit would be 

using drop down menus that also can be filled in with a custom response and can handle if it is not valid. 
and having ready filled destination for ease of access 

the other feature is a clear database function 
so you can clean it up if your wanting to share the program without sharing the interworkings of your computer.

Another is a status label letting you know what you need to do and if something was successful or not.
